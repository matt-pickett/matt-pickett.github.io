# My Website
This is my personal website. It was my final project for CS410: Intro to Web Development at Portland State University. It contains some of my previous work and shows what I can do as a software developer. It is continually updated as I continue developing new projects.

This website was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap.

This site is deployed through GitHub Pages. If you would like to visit it, click [here](https://matt-pickett.github.io/).
